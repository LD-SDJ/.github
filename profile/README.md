## Hi there 👋


**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
- Just to practice some concepts and develop sample projects
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
- every project has its own docs and readme files in it for clarity
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
